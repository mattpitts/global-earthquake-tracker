## User Roles

#### Geologist

As a geologist I want to be able to search for specific ranges of earthquakes and
see them represented on a map in meaningful ways. I would like to see detailed visual
representation of USGS data delivered via an interesting interface.

I am more interested in visualization of specific events over visualization of
a range of events. Things like depth/magnitude mapping at a zoomed-in resolution
are why I would continue to use the app.


#### Random bored internet person

Aa random bored internet person I want flashy visuals that draw me in, and an
interface that is easy to learn how to use. I am not as interested in text data
and would prefer as much visualization as possible.

I would like an interesting set of search parameters set as the default so I can
see what the app does right away. I am more interested in general information
and news articles related to the bigger earthquakes.
